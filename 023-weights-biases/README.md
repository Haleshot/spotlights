# Weights & Biases: Weave with marimo Chat UI

_May 22, 2025_

[Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/) presents a [Weave](https://weave.wandb.ai/) demo that embeds marimo's chat UI for The Weight Room Equipment Co. The demo shows how to get help with gear or escalations, with every interaction logged in W&B's Weave platform for tracking and evaluation.

Weave is a lightweight toolkit for tracking and evaluating LLM applications. You can use it to log and debug language model inputs, outputs, and traces, build evaluations for language model use cases and organize information across the LLM workflow from experimentation to production.
