# Arthur S.: Prompting Application for Attorneys

_March 20, 2025_

[Arthur S.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthrod/) has created an interactive application using marimo that showcases advanced prompting techniques for legal professionals working with Large Language Models (LLMs). The application demonstrates how attorneys can effectively use AI tools in their legal practice, with a focus on structured prompting methodologies.

The project is free and open-source, making it accessible to legal professionals interested in incorporating AI tools into their workflow. [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ¤—%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/arthrod/prompting)
