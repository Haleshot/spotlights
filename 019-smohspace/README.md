# Semyeong: Exploring Venus Cloud Imagery from Akatsuki Mission

_April 24, 2025_

[Semyeong](https://github.com/smoh) has created an interactive marimo notebook that explores Venus cloud imagery from the Akatsuki mission. The notebook leverages xarray for analyzing atmospheric data and includes interactive components that allow users to examine various properties of the images, serving as an educational tool for planetary science visualization. This is significant because planetary science data is often complex and multidimensional and the notebook demonstrates how marimo can transform this data into interactive, accessible tools, making it more approachable for both researchers and the public interested in space exploration.

This project demonstrates the power of marimo for scientific visualization and data exploration in planetary science. [![Open with marimo](https://marimo.io/shield.svg)](https://smoh.github.io/akatsuki-tutorial/live)

## Local Exploration

You can explore the notebook locally by cloning the repository:
