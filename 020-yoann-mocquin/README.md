# Yoann Mocquin: Interactive Geometric MTF Notebook

_April 30, 2025_

[Yoann Mocquin](https://medium.com/@yoann.mocquin) presents an interactive marimo notebook that demonstrates geometric Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) concepts. The notebook uses ray optics and interactive sliders to show how signal, blur, and diffraction affect image quality, visualized live across line-spread and MTF curves.

Yoann is a physics engineer by training and a Python enthusiast. His notebook provides a hands-on way to explore the interplay between optical parameters and image formation, making it a valuable educational tool for anyone interested in optics or imaging science.
