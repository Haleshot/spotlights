# Georgios Varnavides: UC Berkeley Postdoctoral Miller Research Fellow

_August 15, 2024_

[Georgios Varnavides](https://georgiosvarnavides.com/) is a postdoctoral Miller research fellow at UC Berkeley, where he works on material science. He's a marimo power user who cares deeply about digital science communication. üë®‚Äçüî¨üéôÔ∏è

Georgios has been using [marimo's WebAssembly features](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/wasm.html) to create interactive science content that runs directly in the browser. His work spans from notebooks to apps and even interactive slides. One of his notable contributions is an interactive presentation on STEM probes, which you can explore here:

## Innovative Combinations

Georgios has taken his work a step further by finding a way to combine Observable Framework and marimo, utilizing an advanced marimo feature called [marimo islands](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/exporting.html#embed-marimo-outputs-in-html-using-islands) üèùÔ∏è. This innovative approach showcases the flexibility and power of marimo for creating interactive scientific content.

## Local Exploration

Run Georgios' notebook as an app with:

```shell
uvx marimo run --sandbox stem-probes.py
```

if you have `uv` installed, or

```shell
marimo run --sandbox 002-stem-probes/stem-probes.py
```

if you don't have uv installed (you'll need to manually install its dependencies).

To edit the notebook source code, replace `run` with `edit` in the above commands.

## Community Spotlight

Georgios' work is part of our [Community Spotlights](https://marimo.io/c/@haleshot/community-spotlights) collection, where we feature outstanding projects and contributions from the marimo community.

We're thrilled to have Georgios as an active and innovative member of the marimo community. His contributions demonstrate the potential of marimo for creating engaging, interactive scientific content that can run directly in web browsers.
