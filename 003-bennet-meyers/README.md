# Bennet Meyers: SLAC Staff Scientist

_August 22, 2024_

[Bennet Meyers](https://gismo.slac.stanford.edu/person/bennet-meyers) is a
staff scientist at [SLAC](https://slac.stanford.edu), in the [GISMo
lab](https://gismo.slac.stanford.edu/). He's been using marimo for over two
years â€” well before it was open source. Bennet has played a huge role in
shaping and supporting marimo; in fact, marimo probably wouldn't exist without
him. 

Bennet was the first person to ever deploy a marimo notebook, which teaches
readers how to use signal decomposition without math. It was one a motivating
example for many features that are now part of the marimo library. Check it out
here: [https://signal-decomp-tutorial.org/](https://signal-decomp-tutorial.org/]).

You can also edit this notebook locally with

```shell
uvx marimo run --sandbox notebook.py
```

if you have `uv` installed, or

```shell
marimo run notebook.py
```

if you don't have uv installed (you'll need to manually install its dependencies).

To edit the notebook source code, replace `run` with `edit` in the above commands.
