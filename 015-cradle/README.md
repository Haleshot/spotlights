# cradle: GitHub Project Creator for Quant Work and Data Science

_February 7, 2025_

[cradle](https://github.com/tschm/cradle) is a GitHub project creator similar to [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) but with a specific emphasis on quantitative work and data science. Developed by [Thomas Schmelzer (@Thomster78)](https://github.com/tschm), cradle leverages marimo notebooks for experimentation, taking advantage of marimo's reproducibility and reusability features.

cradle is an excellent tool for quantitative researchers and data scientists who need to quickly set up project environments that support both exploration and production-ready code.

We're thrilled to have Thomas Schmelzer as an active and innovative member of the marimo community! His work on cradle demonstrates how marimo can be integrated into development workflows for more reproducible and efficient data science pipelines.

## Local Exploration

You can explore cradle with:
```shell
