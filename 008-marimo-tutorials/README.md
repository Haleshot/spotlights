This week's spotlight shines on the [marimo-tutorials](https://github.com/Haleshot/marimo-tutorials) project, led by [Haleshot](https://github.com/Haleshot) and [eugene](https://github.com/metaboulie). This helps in showcasing innovative projects within the marimo community. It aims to serve as a resource for unique marimo implementations (spanning various domains), complete with links to open them in the community cloud.

## Project Overview

The [marimo-tutorials](https://github.com/Haleshot/marimo-tutorials) repository is a growing collection of interactive tutorials designed to help users learn various topics using marimo notebooks. From data science to programming concepts, these tutorials use marimo's interactive features to create engaging and interactive notebooks.

## Key Features

- **Diverse Topics**: Covers a range of subjects, making it a valuable resource for learners with different interests.
- **Community-Driven**: Open for contributions, encouraging the marimo community to share their knowledge and expertise.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Designed to be accessible to newcomers while also offering depth for more experienced users.

## Featured Tutorials

While the repository is continuously growing, here are some notable tutorials:

1. [Goodreads Dataset EDA](https://github.com/Haleshot/marimo-tutorials/blob/main/marimo-tutorials/Data-Science/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/Goodreads-EDA.py): An exploratory data analysis of the Goodreads dataset.
