# Eugene (metaboulie): marimo Community Contributor

_December 7, 2024_

Eugene ([@metaboulie](https://github.com/metaboulie)) has made significant contributions to the marimo ecosystem through both core improvements and extension libraries. Their work has enhanced marimo's functionality in several key areas, particularly the table viewer and formatting support.

Eugene has created two notable extension libraries that expand marimo's capabilities:

1. [marimo-themes](https://github.com/metaboulie/marimo-themes): A theming management tool that brings custom theming capabilities to marimo notebooks, allowing users to personalize their development environment.

2. [mowidget](https://github.com/metaboulie/marimo-widgets): A comprehensive collection of custom widgets including array viewers, color matrices, and productivity tools that enhance the interactive capabilities of marimo notebooks.

You can try Eugene's extensions locally with:

```shell
# Install theme management tool
pip install motheme

# Install widget collection
pip install mowidget
```

To explore the themes:
```shell
motheme themes
```
