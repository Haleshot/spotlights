# Julian Hofer: marimo + pixi Starter Template

_May 15, 2025_

[Julian Hofer](https://julianhofer.eu) presents a starter template that pairs marimo with pixi for instant environment setup, built-in testing, linting & CI/CD. This template enables developers to dive straight into creating interactive notebooks without worrying about environment configuration.

Julian enjoys dealing with computers, languages and physics â€” especially in combination. He also likes to travel, including the part where you get to listen to audiobooks on long train rides.
