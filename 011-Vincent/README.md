# Vincent Warmerdam: Creative Notebook Developer
*November 14, 2024*

[Vincent Warmerdam](https://twitter.com/fishnets88) is a creative developer (and ambassador!) known for crafting innovative and educational notebooks that make complex concepts accessible and engaging. His contributions to the marimo community have consistently pushed the boundaries of what's possible with interactive notebooks.

Vincent has created some of the most creative notebooks we've seen in the marimo community, combining technical expertise with an intuitive understanding of how to make complex concepts accessible through interactive experiences.

One of his standout contributions is an interactive exploration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which transforms what could be a dry mathematical concept into an engaging hands-on experience. Another notable creation is his implementation of seam carving, inspired by 3Blue1Brown, which demonstrates how complex algorithms can be explained through interactive visualization.

Check out these remarkable notebooks:

- Seam Carving Implementation: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/marimo-team/seam-carving](https://huggingface.co/spaces/marimo-team/seam-carving)

You can run these notebooks locally using:
```shell
uvx marimo run --sandbox <notebook-name>.py
```
if you have `uv` installed, or
```shell
marimo run notebook.py
```
if you don't have uv installed (you'll need to manually install its dependencies).

To edit the notebook source code, replace `run` with `edit` in the above commands.
