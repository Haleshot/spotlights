# Spotlights! ðŸŒŸ

We feature a project or marimo notebook from the community every Thursday!

Have a project that you'd like us to spotlight? Feel free to open an issue.

## Running example notebooks

The example notebooks in this repo have their package dependencies inlined.
If you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, you can open a
notebook with

```shell
uvx marimo edit --sandbox notebook.py
```

and marimo will automatically install its dependencies in an isolated
virtual environment.

1. [Bennet Meyers](003-bennet-meyers/) Bennet Meyers is a staff scientist
   at SLAC who has been a supporter of marimo since day one; he made and

   that teaches how to use signal decomposition.
