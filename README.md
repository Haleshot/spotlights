# Spotlights

We feature a project or marimo notebook from the community every Thursday!

Have a project that you'd like us to spotlight? Feel free to open an issue.

## Running example notebooks

The example notebooks in this repo have their package dependencies inlined.
If you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, you can open a
notebook with


```shell
uvx marimo edit --sandbox notebook.py
```

and marimo will automatically install its dependencies in an isolated
virtual environment.

## Spotlights

1. [anywidget](001-anywidget/) is a Python library for making interoperable
   widgets; use anywidget to make custom UI elements for marimo.
