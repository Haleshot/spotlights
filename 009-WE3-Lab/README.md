# Valuing Energy Flexibility from Water Systems: Stanford WE3 Lab

_October 4, 2024_

This week's spotlight ðŸŒŸ features a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00316-4) by [Akshay Rao](https://x.com/raodoesresearch), [Fletch](https://github.com/fletchapin), and others from Stanford's [WE3 Lab](https://x.com/WE3Lab). Their paper, "[Valuing Energy Flexibility from Water Systems](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00316-4)," is accompanied by a marimo notebook that helps visualize their methods. In this research, they study the efficient operation of water systems in a decarbonizing grid.

## Deployed Notebook

You can explore the interactive notebook here: [![Open with marimo](https://marimo.io/shield.svg)](https://lvof.we3lab.tech/)

## Local Usage

To run this notebook locally, use the following command if you have `uv` installed:

```shell
uvx marimo run --sandbox notebook.py
```

If you don't have `uv` installed, you can use:

```shell
marimo run notebook.py
```

Note: You may need to manually install the notebook's dependencies if you're not using `uv`.

To edit the notebook source code, replace `run` with `edit` in the above commands.
