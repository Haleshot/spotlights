# CVXPY: NASA Convex Optimization Course

*September 05, 2024*

This summer, the [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/) team taught a course on convex optimization to scientists at NASA, powered by marimo notebooks! From designing aircraft to landing rockets, marimo brought their lessons to life.

## Course Details

The CVXPY team used marimo's interactive capabilities to create engaging and hands-on learning experiences for NASA scientists. This collaboration showcases the power of marimo in educational settings, particularly for complex technical subjects like convex optimization.

- Notebooks: [![Open with marimo](https://marimo.io/shield.svg)](https://marimo.io/c/@convex-optimization-nasa/convex-optimization-short-course-nasa)

## Local Exploration

To explore the CVXPY NASA course notebooks locally, you can use the following commands:

```shell
uvx marimo run --sandbox <notebook-name>.py
```

if you have `uv` installed, or

```shell
marimo run <notebook-name>.py
```

if you don't have uv installed (you'll need to manually install its dependencies).

To edit the notebook source code, replace `run` with `edit` in the above commands.
